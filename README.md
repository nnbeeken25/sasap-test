# sasap-test
This is a test repository. It really only has a few roles:
-demonstrate how to create a repository in GitHub
-practice with a commit
-later, we'll see how to access the repository in Rstudio


## Git from Rstudio

From within Rstudio, we can perform the same versioning actions that we can in GitHub, and much more. Plus, we have the natural advantages of the programming IDE with code completion and other features to make our work easier. 

- Add files to version control
- Commit changes
- Push commits to GitHub
